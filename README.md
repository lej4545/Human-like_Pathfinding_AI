# Human-like_Pathfinding_AI

This repository contains python code for data preprocessing and path finding AI.

We use reinforcement learning to let AI find path like human.  
The idea came from the paper, [vector-based pedestrian navigation in cities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07104.pdf).

Our AI can find the optimal path which is as short as possible and does not change directions a lot.  
The result is shown as html file.  
This model can be improved like including less crosswalks.

### Example 1
