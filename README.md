# Human-like_Pathfinding_AI

This repository contains python code for data preprocessing and path finding AI.

We use reinforcement learning to let AI find path like human.
The idea came from the paper, [vector-based pedestrian navigation in cities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07104.pdf).

Our AI can find the optimal path which is as short as possible and does not change direction a lot.
This model can be improved like including less crosswalks.
